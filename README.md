# waterjugproblem
It is one of the common problem in the artificial intelligence, which can be solved by various algorithms.
Here I have used the simple linear programing. This code helps to solve the problem from a given state (amount of water in both jugs) instead starting from (0,0)
You need to enter the maximum capacity of the jugs, water presents in both jugs and the desired output.
